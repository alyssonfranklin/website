# The WIAD Code of Conduct

World IA Day is dedicated to the empowerment of local leaders. Our celebrations inspire the global growth of information architecture as a community of practice. We are dedicated to bringing a diversity of thoughts and thinkers.
Volunteers work hard to bring this amazing celebration to locations all over the world. 

No matter where in the world you are, we want to make sure that World IA Day is a safe experience for all volunteers, attendees, and presenters. As such, the Board of Directors of the Information Architecture Institute have drafted the below code of conduct to be agreed to and upheld by any member of the global and local volunteer teams. This code of conduct applies to all volunteers, all locations, all attendees, and all presenters of World IA Day.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in World IA Day to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 1. We do not tolerate harassment of participants, presenters or volunteers in any form.

Our local teams are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any context revolving around World IA Day, including talks, parties, social media and other online media.

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

*   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
*   Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
*   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
*   Inappropriate photography or recording.
*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

If anyone in the World IA Day community engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the local organizer or global team may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender from World IA Day service or attendance.

### Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 2. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 3. We're listening

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding the conduct of our global or local volunteers, presenters, or attendees, please contact safety@worldiaday.org where a member of our global team is dedicated to assisting all locations. They are trained in how to address and report any incidents brought to their attention. All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

### Should I report it?
If you answer “yes” to any of the following, please let us know.
* Do you feel unsafe or fear that someone else does?
* Do you have prior conduct-violating experience with members of our community that deters your participation in a celebration?
* Are you concerned about the appropriateness of language being used, views being expressed or the materials being shared at any of our celebrations or via our social media channels?
* Did you witness something that you are not sure is appropriate based on our code of conduct?

### What happens if I report something?
* First, we will listen.
* Then, we will help you to determine the options that we have based on the situation. We will also document the details to assure trends of behavior are uncovered across locations.
* Lastly, we will follow the situation to a resolution where you feel safe and you can remain anonymous if you wish to be.  

## 4. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify World IA Day with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## 5. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
